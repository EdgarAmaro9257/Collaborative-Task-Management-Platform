# Collaborative Task Management Platform

The Collaborative Task Management Platform is a web application where users can register, create projects, and manage tasks within those projects. Users can invite other members to join their projects, assign tasks to them, and track the progress of these tasks. The application allows interaction among members through task comments and notifications about changes or updates.

# Main Features

+ **User Authentication**: Registration, login, and password recovery.
+ **Project Management**: Creation, editing, and deletion of projects.
+ **Task Management**: Creation of tasks within a project, assignment of tasks to users, and updating the status of tasks.
+ **Collaboration**: Inviting other users to join a project, adding comments to tasks, and receiving notifications.
+ **Dashboard**: Viewing active projects, pending tasks, and a summary of progress.
+ **Responsive Frontend**: Use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a modern and responsive user interface.

# Technologies to Use

+ **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (jQuery or React for interactivity).
+ **Backend**: Python with Django or Flask.
+ **Database**: MySQL.
+ **Version Control**: Git and GitHub.

# Steps to Develop the Project

### **1. Set Up Development Environment**
  - Install Python and a virtual environment.
  - Install Django or Flask.
  - Set up MySQL and create the database.

### **2. Database Design**
  - Define models for Users, Projects, Tasks, Comments, and Notifications.
  - Relate the models using foreign keys.

### **3. Backend Development**
  - **User Authentication and Management:**
    - Implement the authentication system using Django/Flaskâ€™s user system.
    - Create views for registration, login, and password recovery.
  - **Project and Task Management:**
    - Create views for creating, editing, and deleting projects and tasks.
    - Implement logic for assigning tasks to users.
  - **Collaborative Features:**
    - Implement user invitation functionality to projects.
    - Create functionality for task comments and notifications for users.

### **4. Frontend Development**
- **User Interface Design:**
  - Create HTML pages for main views (login, registration, dashboard, project and task management).
  - Use CSS/Bootstrap to style the pages.
  - Implement frontend logic in JavaScript to enhance interactivity (e.g., dynamic task updates).
- **Frontend-Backend Interaction:**
  - Use AJAX to handle asynchronous requests between the frontend and backend.

### **5. Testing and Validation**
- Perform unit and integration tests on the backend.
- Validate frontend functionality.
- Conduct user testing to ensure the interface is intuitive and functional.
